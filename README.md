# CS-300-DSA-ANALYSIS-AND-DESIGN
**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**
The biggest problem I had in solving my projects for this course was debugging my code.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
I would usually write some code and step away from it. This would give me a fresh perspective as I approached it with more time to think of a solution.
Data strucutures are important to understans because they are the foundation of algorithims. By understanding data structures, you can implement or optimize algorithms to solve complex problems more effectively. 
Also, understanding data strucutures will give you the knowledge of which strucutre to use based on the types of data/files you are working with or what you wish to do with the data.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
Majority of my road blocks came in trying to solve the given problem set for my assignments. I would referrence different resources such as some of my previous work, my textbook, and websties such as W3Schools, GeeksforGeeks, and stackoverflow.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**
I know have a better understanding of data stucutres and more experience writing code. 
Specifically, I used a hash table in my final project because the objective was to print a loaded file and allow for course lookup. Since the hash table is effective when a key retrival is used I used the course ID to be the key to look up course information.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
The biggest thing I've learned from this project is that setting up a good plan with pseudocode and a flow chart can help organize your thoughts and help writing clearner code. 
I also learned to start early in the project so I can give myself more time to get the solution and ask for help if necessary.
